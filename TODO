make here("string") work
support capturing stderr of Pipe
support {fd: CLOSE} after exec
support full I/O redirection
  * subprocess can send stderr to stdout but not vice versa
  * subprocess does not dup(3) higher fd out of the box in fork-exec,
  fortunately this won't have any effect unless the child use fdopen(3).
