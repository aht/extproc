process control -- fork-exec and pipe with I/O redirection

Introduction
============

Design goals:

  * Easy to fork-exec commands, wait or no wait
  * Easy to capture stdout/stderr of children (command substitution)
  * Easy to express I/O redirections
  * Easy to construct pipelines
  * Use short names for easy interactive typing

In effect, make Python a sane alternative to non-trivial shell scripts.

Technically, pc.py is a layer on top of subprocess. The subprocess
module support a rich API but is clumsy for many common use cases,
namely sync/async fork-exec, command substitution and pipelining,
all of which is trivial to do on system shells. [1][2]

This module depends on Python 2.6, or where `subprocess` is available.
Doctests require `/bin/sh` to pass. Tested on Linux.

This is an alpha release. Some features are unimplemented. Expect bugs.


Let's start forking!


Cmd(), Sh() and Pipe()
============================

Those objects hold information to prepare for a fork-exec (or for
Pipe, a series thereof).

The first argument to `Cmd()` should be a list of command argurments.
If a string, it is passed to `shlex.split()`.  Thus,

    >>> Cmd(['grep', 'my stuff']) == Cmd('grep "my stuff"')
    True

`Sh(cmd)` is equivalent to `Cmd(['/bin/sh','-c', cmd])`. It is also a subclass.

To construct a `Pipe()`, pass in a list of Cmd's.

run()
=====

`run()` performs a fork-exec-wait and return the child's exit status, e.g.

    >>> assert 0 == Cmd('true').run()
    >>> found_deadbeaf = Pipe(Cmd('dmesg'), Cmd('grep deadbeaf')).run()


spawn()
=======

`spawn()` performs a fork-exec and returns a `subprocess.Popen` object.
The following is equivalent to a `gvim -f &` on Unix shells:

    >>> gvim = Cmd(['gvim', '-f']).spawn()

You may do what you wish to the Popen object, for instance,

    >>> gvim.kill(15)


capture()
=========

`capture()` also performs a fork-exec-wait but capture the
child's stdin/stderr as file objects when possible, e.g.

    >>> Sh('echo -n foo').capture(1).stdout.read()
    'foo'
    >>> Sh('echo -n bar >&2').capture(2).stderr.read()
    'bar

The full return is a namedtuple `(stdin, stdout, exit_status)`, e.g.

    >>> out, err, status = Sh('echo -n foo; echo -n bar >&2').capture(1, 2)

Capturing is equivalent to shell backquotes aka command substitution
(which cannot capture stderr separate from stdout):

    $ out=`echo -n foo`
    $ outerr=$(echo -n foo; echo -n bar 2>&1 >&2)
    >>> Sh('echo -n foo').capture(1).stdout.read()
    'foo'
    >>> Sh('echo -n bar >&2').capture(2).stderr.read()
    'bar

`cmd()`, `sh()` and`pipe()` are safe shortcuts that setup the capture
of the child(ren)'s stdout, then read and close it, e,g.

    >>> sh('echo -n foo')
    'foo'

The following finds files modified in the last 30 minutes and pipes to
dmenu(1) to select a single item:

    >>> item = pipe(Cmd('find -mmin +30'), Cmd('dmenu'))


I/O redirection
===============

I/O redirections are performed by specifying a `fd` argument which
should be a dict mapping a subset of file descriptors `[0, 1, 2]` to
either open files, strings, or existing file descriptors, e.g.

    >>> sh('echo -n foo; echo -n bar >&2', fd={2: 1})
    'foobar'

The following append the child's stdout to the file 'abc' (equiv. to `echo foo >> abc`)

    >>> sh('echo foo', {1: open('abc', 'a')})

os.devnull (which is just the string `'/dev/null'` on Unix) also works:

    >>> Sh('echo ERROR >&2; echo bogus stuff', {1: os.devnull}).capture(2).stderr.read()
    'ERROR\n'

In fact you can pass in `fd=SILIENCE`, which will send everything
straight to hell, hmm... I mean `/dev/null`.


API REFERENCE
=============

See docstrings for now.


USAGE NOTES
===========

The main interpreter process had better be a single thread, since
forking multithreaded programs is not well understood by mortals. [3]

It is not a good idea to reuse Cmd's objects.


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
====================

capture() use temporary files and is synchronous.  It might be worth
adding an `async=True` option to use `PIPE` for client code that knows
what it is doing.

It is really too bad that `subprocess` does not support full I/O redirection.
