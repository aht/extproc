fork-exec and pipe with I/O redirection

Design goals:
  * Easy to fork-exec, capturing child's stdout/stderr or reuse parent's
  * Easy to construct pipelines
  * Easy to express I/O redirections
  * Easy to type

In effect, make Python more usable as a system shell.

The main interpreter process had better be a single thread, since
forking multithreaded programs is not well understood by mortals.

Doctests require /bin/sh to pass. Tested on Linux.
